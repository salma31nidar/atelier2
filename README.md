# This repository contains code for two distinct parts:

# Part 1: Text Processing and Bill Generation
The first part involves text processing and bill generation. It consists of Python functions to clean text data, extract relevant information such as item names, quantities, and prices, and generate a bill table. Here's a summary of the key functionalities:

Clean Text Function: Removes stop words and extra whitespaces from input text.
Generate Bill Function: Extracts item names, quantities, and prices from the cleaned text and generates a bill table with product details and total prices.

# Part 2: Text Analysis and Visualization
The second part focuses on text analysis using various techniques and visualizing the results. It includes operations like one-hot encoding, bag-of-words, TF-IDF transformation, and word embedding models. Below are the main components:

Text Representation: Utilizes techniques such as one-hot encoding, bag-of-words, and TF-IDF to represent text data in a numerical format.
Word Embedding Models: Applies word embedding models including Skip Gram, CBOW, GloVe, and FastText to generate word vectors for semantic representation.
Visualization: Employs t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) for visualizing high-dimensional word embeddings in 3D space.
